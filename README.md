This is a Protracker .mod player written in C++.

(Translation for the non initiated: This program plays music that people composed on a Commodore Amiga in the late 80s and early 90s. A lot of people still think that sort of thing is cool. If you have to ask why they think it's cool, then you'll probably never know.)

I put it online because people were asking to see it. It can play most mods well enough, but it doesn't handle all effects.

It uses SDL 1.2 for audio output.

It's public domain.
