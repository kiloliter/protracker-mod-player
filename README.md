This is a Protracker .mod player written in C++.

Mod is a music file format which was used for numerous video games and demos in the late 80s and early 90s.

I put it online because people were asking to see it. It can play most mods well enough, but it doesn't handle all effects.

It uses SDL 1.2 for audio output.

It's public domain.
